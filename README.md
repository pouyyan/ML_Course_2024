# ML_Course_2024
This my repository for my assignments in Machine Learning 2024 course. 
Overview

This repository encompasses Python code implementations for machine learning projects, assignments, and exams undertaken during a machine learning course. The content is structured to document the learning journey, provide code references, and potentially contribute to the open-source community.

Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

projects: Contains code for independent machine learning projects.
project1_linear_classification: Implements logistic regression, SGD, and other linear classification models.
project2_decision_trees: Covers decision trees, random forests, and MLPs.
project3_svm_autoencoder: Explores SVMs (including a scratch implementation) and autoencoders.
project4_reinforcement_learning: Focuses on reinforcement learning algorithms and applications.
homeworks: Includes assignments and solutions for homework exercises.
midterm: Contains code related to the midterm exam.
final: Includes code related to the final project or exam.
Dependencies

The code in this repository relies on the following Python libraries:
