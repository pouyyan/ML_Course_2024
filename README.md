# ML Course 2024

## Overview

This repository encompasses Python code implementations for machine learning projects, assignments, and exams undertaken during a machine learning course. The content is structured to document the learning journey, provide code references, and potentially contribute to the open-source community.

### Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

------

**Mini Projects** | Code for independent machine learning projects.
|---|---|
| Mini Project 1 | Implements **logistic regression, SGD, and other linear classification models**. |
| Mini Project 2 | Covers **decision trees, random forests, and MLPs**. |
| Mini Project 3 | Explores **SVMs (including a scratch implementation) and autoencoders**. |
| Mini Project 4 | Focuses on **reinforcement learning algorithms and applications**. |
|---|---|
------

**Exams**
| Midterm Exam | Code related to the midterm exam. |
| Final Exam | Code related to the final exam. |

------

**Bonus Assignments**
| Homeworks | Assignments and solutions for homework exercises. |

The code in this repository relies on the following Python libraries:
